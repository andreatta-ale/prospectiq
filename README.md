# README  

## Project Overview  
This repository provides an implementation of a **Data Platform architecture on Azure**, with a strong focus on reproducibility and code-driven deployments. It demonstrates how ingestion, transformation, and serving layers can be fully automated and managed as code.  

The repository is structured to separate **infrastructure provisioning**, **data transformation notebooks**, and **SQL scripts for serving and optimization**.  

## Core Components  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** → Templates for provisioning Azure Data Lake Storage, Data Factory, Databricks, and Synapse resources.  
- **Data Ingestion Pipelines (ADF)** → Parameterized pipelines for batch ingestion of structured and semi-structured data.  
- **Databricks Notebooks (PySpark)** → Modular notebooks for data cleansing, enrichment, and feature engineering.  
- **Synapse SQL Scripts** → DDL and DML scripts for schema creation, indexing, and performance optimization.  
- **CI/CD Support** → Integration hooks for deployment pipelines using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.

```  

## Deployment Instructions  
1. **Provision Infrastructure**  
   Deploy the base resources using the IaC templates in `infrastructure/`.  
   ```bash
   az deployment group create --resource-group <rg-name> --template-file main.bicep
   ```  

2. **Configure Data Factory**  
   Import the JSON pipeline definitions from `pipelines/` into your ADF instance.  

3. **Deploy Databricks Notebooks**  
   Upload the notebooks from `notebooks/` or use the **Databricks CLI** for automated deployment.  
   ```bash
   databricks workspace import_dir notebooks /Shared/project_notebooks
   ```  

4. **Initialize Synapse Database**  
   Run the SQL scripts in `sql/` to create schemas, external tables, and indexes.  

5. **Run Pipelines**  
   Trigger the ingestion pipelines in ADF and process transformations in Databricks.  

## Requirements  
- **Azure CLI** and **Databricks CLI** configured  
- **Terraform / Bicep** (depending on chosen IaC approach)  
- **Python 3.10+** with `pyspark` and `azure-*` packages installed  
- Proper **Service Principal** permissions for automation  

## Next Improvements  
- Add **unit testing framework** for PySpark transformations.  
- Implement **delta tables** for efficient updates and incremental loads.  
- Extend orchestration with **event-driven triggers** (Event Hubs / Kafka).
